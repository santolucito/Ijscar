# International Journal of Secondary Computing and Applications Research (IJSCAR)

![logo](./logo.png)

Welcome to the official website of the International Journal of Secondary Computing and Applications Research (IJSCAR). IJSCAR is dedicated to publishing high-quality research in the field of computing and applications, with a special focus on researchers in secondary school.

IJSCAR is meant to fill a gap in the space of academic journals. While there are many journals that publish research in computing, there are few that are specifically designed to cater to the needs of secondary school students. 
Existing journals for high school students are often more focused on science research in general and do not provide a dedicated platform for computing research.
Computing research has a fundamentally different methodology and set of tools compared to other scientific disciplines, and we believe that it is important to provide a space where young researchers can publish their work and engage with the broader computing research community.
We believe that by providing a platform for young researchers to publish their work, we can help to foster the next generation of computing researchers.

## About IJSCAR

The International Journal of Secondary Computing and Applications Research (IJSCAR) is a peer-reviewed academic journal that focuses on the latest advancements in secondary computing and its applications. Our mission is to disseminate cutting-edge research that can contribute to the development and understanding of computing. Every paper must include at least one co-author who is enrolled in secondary school at the time of submission.

## Editorial Board

- **Editor-in-Chief:** Dr. Maria Hwang, Fashion Institute of Technology
- **Editorial Board:**
  - Dr. Mark Santolucito, Barnard College, Columbia University

## Submission Guidelines

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit their original research papers, literature reviews, and case studies. Manuscripts should be formatted according to the following guidelines:

1. **Format:** Manuscripts should be submitted in MS Word or LaTeX format.
2. **Length:** Articles should not exceed 10 pages, not including references and appendices.
3. **Submission:** Send your manuscript to [submission@ijscar.org](mailto:submission@ijscar.org).

### Timeline


### Review Process

Each of the reviewers will assign a score to the paper of 

- Accept as is
- Accept with minor revisions
- Major revisions required
- Reject

The final decision will be made by the editor-in-chief based on the reviews and the scores of the reviewers.

To ensure a high level of academic rigor, all submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process. This means that the identities of the authors and reviewers will be kept confidential.
All reviewers are experts in the field of computing and applications research and will provide detailed feedback to help authors improve their work.
Specifically all reviewers hold a PhD in a relevant field. 
We do allow subreviews from graduate students of professors who are reviewers, as a way to engage the next generation of researchers in the review process.
All reviewers (or subreviewers where relevant) will be paid a stipend for their review.

The timeline for the review process is as follows:

- **Initial Submission** 
- **Initial Reviews:** Within two weeks of submission 
- **Rebuttal Due:** One week after receiving reviews
- **Final Decision:** One week after rebuttal

### Specific Requirements for High School Student Authors

At IJSCAR, we require that at least one author of each submission be a high school student. 
This is to ensure that the journal remains focused on the needs and interests of secondary school students.

## Publishing Policy

All articles are published as open-access and are assigned a DOI so that they can be indexed by major databases, facilitating easy access, citation, and integration into academic and research libraries.

There is no fee to submit an article.
For accepted papers, we charge a $500 USD administrative fee. 
Typically, academic journals do not pay their reviewers - we run a unique model where all reviewers are paid a modest stipend per review.
This helps to cover the costs of the review and publication.
